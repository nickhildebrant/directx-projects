# DirectX11 Projects
>Here is my newest development in Computer Graphics programming. After learning a lot about game engines and computer graphics, I am continuing my learning with DirectX. Programming for the WinAPI and using the DirectX library is a lot and will take a lot of time, but I look forward to implementing the graphics rendering techniques I learned in my Graphics for Games class such as shadow mapping, SSAO, and the Catmull-Clark Subdivision algorithm.

>Below is the result from following DirectXTutorials.com DirectX-11 tutorial, my first jump into Computer Graphics programming. Just a simple start learning how to create a window and use Vertex and Pixel Shaders to create an image. Learning this is what made me interested in learning 3D rendering.
