# DirectX11 Projects
>Here is my newest development in Computer Graphics programming. After learning a lot about game engines and computer graphics using the XNA Framework in C#, I am continuing my learning with DirectX in C++. Programming for the WinAPI and using the DirectX library is a lot and will take a lot of time, but I look forward to implementing the graphics rendering techniques I learned in my Graphics for Games class such as shadow mapping, SSAO, and the Catmull-Clark Subdivision algorithm.
